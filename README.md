# Lecture Notes

## Lecture 1: Overview

**Two Major Strategies which Language Implemented**

- Interpreters run your progam
- Compilers translate your program 

**Language Implementations**

- Bach compilation systems dominate "low level" languages.(C, C++, Rust, Go)
- "Higher level" languages are often interpreted.(Python, Ruby)
- Some(e.g., Java, JavaScript) provide both(Interpreter + JIT Compiler)

**The Structure of Compiler**

1. Lexical Analysis
2. Parsing
3. Semantic Analysis
4. Optimization
5. Code Generation

## Lecture 2: Language Design

**Why So many languages**

- Application domains have distinctive and conflicting needs.

**History of Ideas**

- Abstraction
- Type: Provide various ways to implement abstractions
- Reuse

**Cool Overview**
